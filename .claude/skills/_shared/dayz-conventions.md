# DayZ Modding Conventions (L2)

These rules apply to every DayZ-related agent and skill in this repo. They sit *below* the L1 default rules in `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` / `GEMINI.md` and *above* any individual agent or skill. When a DayZ agent or skill is invoked, it should read this file in addition to L1.

## EnScript code style

For all Enforce Script (`.c`) work, follow the **[EnScript Style Guide](enscript-style.md)** sitting alongside this file. It's the authoritative source for naming (`m_`/`s_`, PascalCase methods, camelCase locals, tabs), `ref`/`autoptr` rules (members only — never on params, returns, locals, or typedefs), `modded class` patterns (no inheritance clause), null-check semantics, `IsDedicatedServer()` over `IsClient()/IsServer()` during load, segfault traps, and more. When code in `workspace/` conflicts with that guide, the guide wins unless the user says otherwise.

## Environment

- **`P:\` drive must be mounted** by DayZ Tools before any DayZ work. **Every DayZ skill that *does* work MUST gate on `/dayz-preflight`** at the start of execution and halt if preflight returns non-zero — including offline-only skills like scaffolding. The discipline of "preflight first" keeps the workflow uniform and catches a dismounted drive at the first action of a session, not the third.
- **Abort-skill exception.** Skills that *only abort* in-flight work (currently `/dayz-stop-test` killing diag processes) do NOT gate on preflight — they're emergency escape hatches that must work even when the environment is half-broken. This is the only documented exception to the gating rule.
- DayZ Tools must be installed via Steam (Tools section).
- Vanilla DayZ data must be unpacked under `P:\` so configs can inherit from base classes.
- Workshop deploy folder for in-development mods: `P:\Mods\@<ModName>\Addons\`.
- **`P:\Mods\` MUST be a directory junction to `<DayZ install>\!Workshop\`**, not a regular folder. The DayZ engine and Launcher load mods from the `!Workshop` folder; the `P:\Mods\` junction lets builds deploy via the canonical `P:\Mods\@<ModName>\Addons\<ModName>.pbo` path while landing in the actual workshop dir. Skills MUST verify this via the shared `validate_p_mods()` resolver in `dayz-preflight/preflight.py`. The resolver **auto-creates the junction at preflight time** when `P:\Mods\` is absent and the DayZ game install (with `!Workshop\`) is locatable — `mklink /J` is non-destructive, doesn't need admin, and the target is canonical. It still hard-fails when the existing path is the wrong shape (real folder, dangling junction, or junction pointing elsewhere) so accidental damage is impossible. Never `output/`.

### Optional environment variables

Skills resolve paths in this order: env var → Windows registry (Tools only) → common-default fallback. Set these only if your install lives outside the defaults.

| Variable | Points to | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `DAYZ_TOOLS_PATH` | DayZ Tools install root (the directory containing `Bin\AddonBuilder\AddonBuilder.exe`). | Preflight, build, any skill that invokes AddonBuilder. |
| `DAYZ_GAME_PATH` | DayZ game install root (containing `DayZ_x64.exe` and `DayZDiag_x64.exe`). | Preflight; resolver for the diag client. |
| `DAYZ_DIAG_PATH` | Direct path to `DayZDiag_x64.exe` (override for non-standard installs). | Launch-test. |
| `DAYZ_SERVER_PATH` | DayZ Server install root (containing retail `DayZServer_x64.exe`). **Not used by `/dayz-launch-test`** (which uses diag for both ends). Reserved for hypothetical future retail-server skills. | reserved |
| `DAYZ_VANILLA_DATA_PATH` | Folder on `P:\` containing the unpacked vanilla DayZ PBOs (default candidates: `P:\dz`, `P:\DZ`, `P:\dta`). | Preflight; future skills that read vanilla configs for inheritance. |
| `DAYZ_WORK_DRIVE` | Folder to mount as `P:\`. Auto-resolved from DayZ Tools' `settings.ini` `[ProjectDrive] path` if not set. | `/dayz-mount-p`. |

Skills MUST use the shared resolver helpers (`find_dayz_tools`, `find_vanilla_data` in `dayz-preflight/preflight.py`) rather than re-implementing path discovery. This keeps the resolution order consistent across the whole DayZ skill set.

## RAG embedding (cloud, optional)

The RAG layer (`/dayz-rag-index` + the `dayz-rag` MCP server) runs against **Voyage AI** (`voyage-code-3` by default, 1024-dim, asymmetric encoding: `input_type="document"` at index time, `input_type="query"` at search time). Free tier covers ~3 full vanilla rebuilds. Add `VOYAGE_API_KEY=pa-…` to `.env` at the repo root before running `/dayz-rag-index` or any agent that uses `search_dayz_source`.

- Skip the build entirely with `/dayz-rag-download` — pulls a prebuilt vanilla+wiki index from GitHub releases (~1 min). No key needed for download; query-time embedding still requires the key.
- Full local rebuild via `/dayz-rag-index --full` is ~25-30 min and 5-65M tokens depending on the corpus and model.
- Without a key, agents fall back to `Grep` over `P:\scripts\` and the documented vanilla paths — fully functional, just less smart.

DayZ Tools is the only per-machine install needed. The Voyage key is per-clone (`.env` is gitignored by default).

## Project layout

- Mod source goes under `workspace/<ProjectName>/` per L1 conventions.
- Standard skeleton:
  - `config.cpp` — engine declarations (`CfgPatches`, `CfgMods`, content classes)
  - `$PBOPREFIX$` — declares the in-game path (e.g. `MyMod\Data`)
  - `scripts/` — Enforce Script (`3_Game/`, `4_World/`, `5_Mission/`)
  - `data/` — models (`.p3d`), textures (`.paa`), materials (`.rvmat`)
  - `gui/` — UI layouts (`.layout`) + controllers
  - `worlds/` — map / world data
- A directory junction `P:\<ProjectName>\` → `workspace/<ProjectName>/` is created at scaffold time by `/dayz-new-mod`. AddonBuilder and the engine read from `P:\<ProjectName>\`; you edit at `workspace/<ProjectName>/`. One source of truth, no copies. Build skills MUST verify this junction exists; they MUST NOT create or modify it (that's `/dayz-new-mod`'s job).
- Built `.pbo` deploys to `P:\Mods\@<ModName>\Addons\`.

## Asset conventions

- Textures are `.paa` only, with required suffixes:
  - `_co` — color (diffuse)
  - `_nohq` — normal
  - `_smdi` — spec / mask
- Materials are `.rvmat` referencing the textures and assigning shaders.
- Models are `.p3d` exported from Object Builder.

## Config conventions

- `config.cpp` is the canonical declaration entry point.
- Use `hiddenSelections` + `hiddenSelectionsTextures` for retextures — avoid duplicating models.
- Inherit from vanilla classes — requires `P:\` vanilla data populated.

## Script conventions

- Enforce Script (DayZ's C#-like language).
- Folder modules:
  - `scripts/3_Game/` — base game logic
  - `scripts/4_World/` — world-level logic
  - `scripts/5_Mission/` — mission / server scripts
- Use `modded class Foo extends Foo { ... }` for non-destructive overrides.

## Server / economy

- `types.xml` — Central Economy spawn rates, lifetimes, locations.
- `cfgeconomycore.xml`, `cfgspawnabletypes.xml`, `events.xml` — economy structure.
- `cfggameplay.json` — runtime tuning.
- `mission/init.c` — server-side world init logic.

## Testing

- **DayZ cannot be tested standalone for mod work.** A local server MUST be loaded with the same mod set as the client. Every test/launch skill MUST start a local server alongside the client — never client-only.
- **Both client and server MUST be `DayZDiag_x64.exe`, not the retail binaries.** Retail `DayZ_x64.exe` (client) and `DayZServer_x64.exe` (server) both block past the loading screen when `-filePatching` is enabled, but `-filePatching` is required for live source iteration (so the engine reads raw `.cpp`/`.c` from the `P:\<ModName>\` junction). The same `DayZDiag_x64.exe` runs in either mode — pass `-server` for server mode.
- DayZ Diag lives in the DayZ game install dir alongside the retail exe. The DayZ Server Steam install (appid 223350) is NOT required for diag-mode testing; it's only relevant for retail-server testing (which is a separate skill if/when added).
- The shared resolver is `find_dayz_diag()` in `dayz-preflight/preflight.py` (env `DAYZ_DIAG_PATH` → DayZ game install → Steam fallbacks). Use it; do not re-implement.
- **Server `serverDZ.cfg` MUST contain `allowFilePatching = 1;`** for clients launched with `-filePatching` to connect. Without it the connection fails with `0x00020005` ("The server does not support the client's current filePatching setting"). `/dayz-launch-test` auto-bakes this into the default cfg and auto-appends it to existing cfgs that lack it.
- **Server staging area lives at `workspace/_server/`**, with two subtrees and the client profile at the root:
  - `workspace/_server/missions/<mission-template>/` — **editable copies** of mission folders (e.g. `dayzOffline.chernarusplus/`). Created by `/dayz-add-map` on demand from DayZ Server's `mpmissions/`; user-editable thereafter (server runs with `-filePatching` so edits are live). Never edit the original DayZ Server install.
  - `workspace/_server/maps/<map-name>/` — per-map `serverDZ.cfg` + `profiles/`. Created by `/dayz-add-map`. Each map (chernarus, livonia, sakhal, custom) has its own config + server-side log/BattlEye state so tuning doesn't bleed across maps.
  - `workspace/_server/!ClientDiagLogs/` is the **client `-profiles=` directory**. All client-side diag artifacts (`Users/`, `DataCache/`, `BattlEye/`, RPT logs, script logs) get contained in that one folder rather than spreading across the `_server` root or polluting the DayZ game install dir.
- **Setup vs run is split into two skills.** `/dayz-add-map <map>` does setup (mission copy + per-map cfg + profiles). `/dayz-launch-test <mod> --map <map>` does run (verify + spawn). The launch skill never copies missions, never writes cfgs from scratch — it refuses with a hint to run `/dayz-add-map` if state is missing. Only mutation launch does is auto-append `allowFilePatching = 1;` to an existing cfg that lacks it.
- **Never gitignore `workspace/_server/` template-wide.** It's a per-clone decision: some users want their tuned cfgs and edited missions tracked in their project's git, others don't. The template doesn't enforce.

## UI scripting realities (read this before any "change the X color" task)

DayZ's UI does NOT have a centralized theme system. There is no `PrimaryAccentColor` constant that flows through every widget. Reds (or any color) come from three independent places, each requiring a different override approach:

1. **`.layout` files in `P:\gui\layouts\` (100+ files).** Color attributes are baked per-widget as RGBA values. **Modded class doesn't apply** — you'd ship a same-named layout in your mod's `gui/layouts/` to override, which clobbers the entire layout (heavyweight; brittle across DayZ updates).
2. **Inline ARGB literals in `P:\scripts\5_mission\gui\` (10+ files).** Code like `widget.SetColor(0xFFD70D11)` directly applies a hex color. Override the *containing class's method* (the function that calls `SetColor`) via `modded class`, NOT the constant.
3. **`Colors` / `FadeColors` constants in `P:\scripts\3_game\colors.c`.** These look like the obvious target, but **`modded class Colors { const int X = ...; }` is a no-op for compile-time constants** — callers already baked the original value at compile time. Re-declaring in a subclass changes nothing. Worse, `COLOR_DAYZ_RED` (the most-named "DayZ red") is referenced in exactly ONE place across vanilla scripts (`mainmenupromo.c:158`), so even a working override would only recolor the main-menu promo banner.

**Implication:** "change all the red UI to blue" is not a one-file task. It requires sweeping `.layout` files (per-widget replacement) AND finding every `SetColor(<red ARGB>)` call in `5_mission/gui/` to override the containing class's method. This is hours of work, not minutes.

**This is why DayZ's CUI (Community UI Framework) exists** — it provides the centralized theme layer the engine doesn't. For new mods that need theming, build on top of CUI rather than fighting vanilla scatter. For one-off recolors, scope the task to a specific element (e.g. "the main menu hover color") rather than "all red".

When the user requests a color/theme change: ask for scope FIRST (single element vs. sweep) and warn them about the layout/script split BEFORE invoking any agent.

## Mission and DayZ Server install notes

- The launch skill passes `-mission=<absolute path to workspace/_server/missions/<template>>` to pin the mission folder explicitly (the engine otherwise looks in the diag binary's local `mpmissions/`, which doesn't exist in the DayZ game install).
- DayZ Server install (Steam appid 223350) is **only required for the initial mission bootstrap**. After missions are copied to `workspace/_server/missions/`, DayZ Server can be uninstalled — the workspace copy is the source of truth.

## Vanilla source recall — `search_dayz_source` MCP tool

The `dayz-rag` MCP server exposes semantic search over indexed vanilla DayZ source: `.c` (Enforce Script under `P:\scripts\`), `.layout` (GUI under `P:\gui\`), and `.cpp`/`.cfg`/`.hpp`/`.h` config blocks (under `P:\dz\` and friends). Backed by a per-user LanceDB index at `~/.claude/dayz-rag-index/`, built and rebuilt by `/dayz-rag-index --full`. Embeddings run via Voyage AI (`voyage-code-3` by default) — set `VOYAGE_API_KEY` in `.env` at the repo root.

**Default to Grep for code-shaped questions** (class names, symbol lookups, exact strings, inheritance trees via `class X extends Y` patterns). `Grep` over `P:\scripts\` is sub-second and exhaustive.

**When to reach for `search_dayz_source` instead:**

- "How does vanilla handle X?" questions where you don't already know the symbol name. The semantic index returns chunks ranked by *meaning*, not keyword match.
- Two or three Grep guesses already came up empty — that's the signal you don't know the right term and semantic similarity earns its slot.
- Browsing for vanilla examples to mirror (e.g. "find a vanilla layout that uses scrollbars").

**When NOT to use it:**

- You already know the exact class/symbol name and want a literal match — that's `Grep` territory.
- You need binary content (`.p3d`, `.paa`) — only text formats are indexed.
- You need files outside the indexed set (`.rvmat` materials, `types.xml`, `events.xml`, `layers.cfg`, `.json`, `.csv`) — those are excluded by design and stay `Grep` territory.

**Tool surface (from the agent's perspective):**

- `search_dayz_source(query, top_k=5, file_type=None)` — semantic search, returns chunks with `path`, `parent_context`, `line_start`/`line_end`, score, and a 1500-char snippet. `file_type` filter: `"c"` | `"cpp"` | `"hpp"` | `"h"` | `"layout"` | `"cfg"` | `None`.
- `get_dayz_file(path, line_start=None, line_end=None)` — fetch full or partial file content for follow-up after a search hit. Sandboxed to paths under `P:\`.
- `list_indexed_sources()` — manifest summary; useful to confirm what was indexed and when.

**Setup gate:** Each DayZ specialist agent assumes the index has been built. If `search_dayz_source` returns `"no index"`, instruct the user to run `/dayz-rag-index --full` first. After a DayZ update, the index goes stale — rerun with `--full` to refresh.

## How agents and skills reference this file

Each DayZ agent or skill should include a one-line reference near the top of its definition:

> Follow `.claude/skills/_shared/dayz-conventions.md`.

That single line is enough — the agent/skill is expected to read this file when invoked.
